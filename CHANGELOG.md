## [Unreleased]
### Changed
 - Changed a core functionality of the graphics module - now you do not have to specify the Graphic to attach to when creating elements; easing the creation and making everyone more happy.
 - Modified the graphics' font to use markdown and changed the core font's variable names due to variable height to be simpler!
 - Made the Game.sound.Beep better; with different kinds of sound waves for different kinds of beeps.
