# Roadmap
## Current version: Structure
 - [x] Completly redo the file directory structure for the pypi package
 - [ ] Make all the demos work (add some, remove others)
 - [ ] Make `__main__.py` work again!
## Next version: Speed
 - [ ] Make graphics run WAY faster (currently EXTREMLY SLOW)
 - [ ] Make `loading.py` MUCH faster (can rewrite it if you want, just need to also update `graphics.py`)
 - [ ] Make GO.PNEW easier (e.g. have GO.P___ all have their functions in them and stuff so you don't need GO.PSTACKS)

# Important todos (for after everything gets back to normal)
 - [ ] Add optional requirements ([example](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/blob/main/setup.py))
 - [ ] Add type annotations
 - [ ] Make multiple different terrain gens for some fast and some slow generation!
 - [ ] Make the buttons in the LDTK window do something

# What I'm working on:

Stages of production (SOP):
 1. just an idea at the moment
 2. early stages
 3. in progress, you can test it out
 4. finished, but more features/stuff coming soon
 5. finished, probably only going to get an update once every blue moon

Testable things can be tested from the demos in `__main__.py` or from `demos.py`
