# Roadmap
## Current version: Structure
 - [x] Completly redo the file directory structure for the pypi package
 - [ ] Make all the demos work (add some, remove others)
 - [ ] Make `__main__.py` work again!
## Next version: Speed
 - [ ] Make graphics run WAY faster and **efficient** (currently EXTREMLY SLOW)
 - [ ] Make `loading.py` MUCH faster (can rewrite it if you want, just need to also update `graphics.py`)
 - [ ] Make GO.PNEW easier (e.g. have GO.P___ all have their functions in them and stuff so you don't need GO.PSTACKS)
 - [ ] Fix import system to make things load faster
 - [ ] Make progressbars load stuff in the background for faster launching of the app
## Version after: GUI
 - [ ] Add more elements (see Firefox's Acorn)
 - [ ] Add some pretty <u>G</u>UI made by my lovelly pixelarting
## NEXT MAJOR VERSION!
 - [ ] Make the buttons in the LDTK window do something
## Version after that
 - [ ] Make multiple different terrain gens for some fast and some slow generation!
## Every version following:
 - Add more stuff to the node editor and stuff!
## When I get to next major version after that:
 - When I can make a game that I feel like I can submit to a game jam or something
 - May take way longer than it should to make the game, that's for versions following to fix
 - May also not be the next Mario either

# Important todos to do at some point
 - [ ] Add optional requirements ([example](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/blob/main/setup.py))
 - [ ] Add type annotations

# What I'm working on:

Stages of production (SOP):
 1. just an idea at the moment
 2. early stages
 3. in progress, you can test it out
 4. finished, but more features/stuff coming soon
 5. finished, probably only going to get an update once every blue moon

Testable things can be tested from the demos in `__main__.py` or from `demos.py`

# ![Ideas](https://badgen.net/badge/%20/Ideas?color=pink&label=)
 - Hyperanalysis Drive (also known as Qibli Simulator); Track player's every move to feed into an algorithm for personalised gameplay
 - OFTEN (Old Fashioned Times Engineering Nuiances) (Acronym subject to change); Try to make a game with old fashioned hardware! Makes making a game much harder, the result much worse, but it just shows you how hard it was back then, and it'll be such a cool feat too!
