# Welcome to âœ¨ Spark Sudios!
(purposeful typo, if you wanted to know - for all of those whos `t` key is broken :D)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

# CURRENT VERSION: v0.0.1 âœ¨

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
3. This is probably my best formed git repo I've ever made :)
4. *Some* of the code was AI generated. Please do not kill me for that. I have written in those files which is and isn't from an AI.
5. This project comes with 2 python libraries built into it, [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package

# How to install
TODO: show how to install with git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
