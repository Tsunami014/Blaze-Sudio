(And for all those who love catchphrases: `Oh, I want to make a game the easy way! How?` `I'll Blaze it!` (like "I'll chatGPT it" but cooler üòé))

# THIS REPO IS VERY WEIRD AT THE MOMENT, CHECK BACK LATER

## Come back later for what you can test and what you cannot

Also please note that this is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! I would love to have some help with this project!

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
5. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix), Pyldtk and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)
6. `git merge [branch2]` will not delete the second branch. DO NOT USE `git rebase [branch2]` AS A REPLACEMENT
