(but really, if you look in the commits it's just me) (At the MOMENT, I'm hoping I can get others to help too if they want!)

(Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name!)

# What I'm working on:

Stages of production (SOP):
 1. just an idea at the moment
 2. early stages
 3. in progress, you can test it out
 4. finished, but more features/stuff coming soon
 5. finished, probably only going to get an update once every blue moon

TODO: move TP_map.png & credits.md into some subfolder
TODO: remove todo.md
TODO: move more things into utils folder
TODO: make subfolders inside utils folder and put things in it

Also please note that this is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! I would love to have some help with this project!

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
5. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix), Pyldtk and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)
6. `git merge [branch2]` will not delete the second branch. DO NOT USE `git rebase [branch2]` AS A REPLACEMENT
