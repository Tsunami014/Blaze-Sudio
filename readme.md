# Welcome to ✨ Spark Sudios!
(Thanks to the one and only (@Imzafish) for the name!)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to @Faunder.real for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

# CURRENT VERSION: v0.0.1 ✨

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
5. This project comes with 2 python libraries built into it, [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package

(ignore the missing numbers)

# How to install
TODO: show how to install with git
