(but really, if you look in the commits it's just me) (At the MOMENT, I'm hoping I can get others to help too if they want!)

In the docs you can find anything you need, including how to install. If you are working offline, you can look [here](docs/SUMMARY.md) for all the pages in the docs to look at them (because all the docs are on this repo)

(Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name!)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

Also please note that this is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! I would love to have some help with this project!

Things to note:
1. # **<u>Still in progress</u>**
2. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix), [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)
