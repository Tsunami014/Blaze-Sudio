# Welcome to ðŸ”¶ Ember Sudios!
(Thanks to the one and only Riley Dowsenator (@Imzafish) for the name!)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to @Faunder.real for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

# CURRENT VERSION: v1.1.0-alpha ðŸ”¶

## CURRENT THINGS THAT WORK THAT YOU CAN TEST:
 - world.py
 - conversation_parser.py
 - __main__.py (tho it does not do much) (please note: NOT main.py; they are 2 SEPARATE FILES)
## There are some things that may/may not work, and are currently being modified to work with __main__.py

Also please note that this is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! I would love to have some help with this project!

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
5. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix), Pyldtk and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)

TODO: get link to Pyldtk

# How to install
TODO: show how to install with git
Please note: requirements file may be wrong. Please contact me if they are.

```

## Ideas
The purpose of this bit here is ideas so that later when I am wondering what features to put in I can attempt making these and see what *isn't* there to put in
 - Super Mario Galaxy 3
 - LOZ Tears of the Kingdom 2
 - Dragon animation studio
 - Newest Super Mario bros ~~WII~~
 - Bluey AI

Please ignore the fact these sound like rip-offs or that it's copying. I don't care. This is meant to be a fun project. These'll all be fan-made. I'm not planning to become rich off of those games. 

## Next versions coming soon:
 - v2.0.0 - ðŸ’¥`Flare Sudio` - got a world and storyline and actually is playable!!!!
 - v3.0.0 - ðŸŒ‹`Fire Sudio` - cos by then it'll be on fire :grin: - all functionality complete!
 - v4.0.0 - ðŸ”¥`Blaze Sudio` - Unity integration! (And for all those who love catchphrases: `Oh, I want to make a game the easy way! How?` `I'll Blaze it!` (like "I'll chatGPT it" but cooler ðŸ˜Ž))
