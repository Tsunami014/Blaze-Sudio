# Welcome to Baze Sudios!

![Contributers: 2](https://badgen.net/github/contributors/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio)
(but really, if you look in the commits it's just me) (At the MOMENT, I'm hoping I can get others to help too if they want!)

(Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name!)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

# CURRENT VERSION: v1.3.0-alpha (🔶 Ember)

(And for all those who love catchphrases: `Oh, I want to make a game the easy way! How?` `I'll Blaze it!` (like "I'll chatGPT it" but cooler 😎))

# THIS REPO IS VERY WEIRD AT THE MOMENT, CHECK BACK LATER

## Come back later for what you can test and what you cannot

Also please note that this is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! I would love to have some help with this project!

Things to note:
1. # **<u>still in progress</u>**
5. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix), Pyldtk and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (the main big one) It can't be installed with pip (maybe it got taken down? I don't know)
    2. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages
    3. I can modify it myself
    4. You guys don't have to install another package
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)
6. `git merge [branch2]` will not delete the second branch. DO NOT USE `git rebase [branch2]` AS A REPLACEMENT

## Game Ideas
The purpose of this bit here is ideas so that later when I am wondering what features to put in I can attempt making these and see what *isn't* there to put in
 - The metro game (stocks but with your stuff and on metro)
 - Super Mario Galaxy 3
 - LOZ Tears of the Kingdom 2
 - Dragon animation studio
 - Newest Super Mario bros ~~WII~~
 - Bluey AI
 - Hey Grapefruit desktop
 - Wings of fire Jade Mountain adventures
 - A game where you go through all the games above and end really bittersweet (do NOT stuff up on the music for this one)

And my ultimate goal:
## To make something where you input your idea and it generates you a game from the description
## OR, to input the name of a movie, TV show, existing game, etc. and it to make you a game based off of that

So I can finally watch the rest of Game of Thrones without it being a piece of junk

That was a joke I've never actually seen Game of Thrones before, just the review graphs on IMDB

Or actually go through a movie or something again with a more immersive experience, but where you DON'T know the ending because YOU are the one who can make the whole storyline change

# Quote me on these:
## Please ignore the fact these are rip-offs or that it's copying. I don't care. This is meant to be a fun project. These'll all be fan-made. I'm not planning to become rich off of those games. I made them for my own enjoyment and I'm showing them here so the world can enjoy it with me.
## ALSO for my own personal reminder: These games should all have endings. I started making this on the hope that it can make me stuck in a game forever and never end. As I'm coming through with this's development, I now realise that all good things must come to an end. It'll just be SO SAD oh my GOSH but I want my users to feel happy; They got to play the game of their dreams, and it would've ended happily, but still ended. There's no going back. It's all known territory. So the only thing left to do is to move on and embrace the change. (I want all the games to have a bittersweet ending)

# Next versions coming soon:
 - v2.0.0 - 💥`Flare` - got a world and storyline and actually is playable!!!!
 - v3.0.0 - 🌋`Fire` - cos by then it'll be on fire :grin: - all functionality complete!
 - v4.0.0 - 🔥`Blaze` - AI generate you the game! (And help you create the game by generating bits of it)
 - v5.0.0 - ?`Bonfire` - Unity integration!
 - v6.0.0 - ?`Inferno` - ???
(You can suggest me any name/emoji on Discord for anything)
