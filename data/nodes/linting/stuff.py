# Funcs:

#def Name(name: str): # We don't need this anymore
#    '''Give this function a name'''
#    pass

# INFO:

'''
Use this if you want:
```
if type(A) != type(B): raise TypeError('Mismatching types!!!')
t = type(A)
```
'''

'''
How this works is the dict is the outputs' names to replace by a new value
So in this case the output with the name 'Out' gets shown as A + B instead 
of it's original 'Out' value if this doesn't error and has all things connected
