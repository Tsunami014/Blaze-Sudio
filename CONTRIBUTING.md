# Contributing
If you would like to report a bug, security vulnerability, request a feature, etc. then [make a new issue about it](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/issues/new/choose). If you know how to code, you can fork this repo and make a PR!

Just modifying whitespace or anything else that doesn't actually do anything won't be accepted (but if it's a spelling misteak or a broken link or something then you can tell me about it on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xr3phyEZtv).)

Thanks for any help making Blaze Sudios even better!!
