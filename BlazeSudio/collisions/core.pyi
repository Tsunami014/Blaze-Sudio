        byteorder
          The byte order used to represent the integer.  If byteorder is 'big',
          the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array.  If
          byteorder is 'little', the most significant byte is at the end of the
          byte array.  To request the native byte order of the host system, use
          sys.byteorder as the byte order value.  Default is to use 'big'.
        signed
          Indicates whether two's complement is used to represent the integer.
