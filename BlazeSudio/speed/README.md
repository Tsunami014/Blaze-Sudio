# What this does
This code compiles all .pyx files in the entire Blaze Sudio module!

# How to build
1. `pip install stubgen-pyx "numpy>=1.7"`
2. `python3 BlazeSudio/speed/setup.py`
3. Wait for it to finish :)

## The auto builds
The code will manually be built into linux and windows for python versions 3.11+ each time I feel like it, but always before new releases if anything changed. Please do not build it yourself and make a PR, instead please contact me and I may/may not build it for you or add your version/distro/something to the auto build script :)
