## Game Ideas
The purpose of this bit here is ideas so that later when I am wondering what features to put in I can attempt making these and see what *isn't* there to put in
 - The metro game (stocks but with your stuff and on metro)
 - Super Mario Galaxy 3
 - LOZ Tears of the Kingdom 2
 - Dragon animation studio
 - Newest Super Mario bros ~~WII~~
 - Bluey AI
 - Hey Grapefruit desktop
 - Something for vtubing
 - Wings of fire Jade Mountain adventures
 - A game where you go through all the games above and end really bittersweet (do NOT stuff up on the music for this one)

# Ultimate goal
To make something where you input your idea and it generates you a game from the description
OR, to input the name of a movie, TV show, existing game, etc. and it to make you a game based off of that

# Quote me on these:
Please ignore the fact these are rip-offs or that it's copying. I don't care. This is meant to be a fun project. These'll all be fan-made. I'm not planning to become rich off of those games. I made them for my own enjoyment and I'm showing them here so the world can enjoy it with me.
ALSO for my own personal reminder: These games should all have endings. I started making this on the hope that it can make me stuck in a game forever and never end. As I'm coming through with this's development, I now realise that all good things must come to an end. It'll just be SO SAD oh my GOSH but I want my users to feel happy; They got to play the game of their dreams, and it would've ended happily, but still ended. There's no going back. It's all known territory. So the only thing left to do is to move on and embrace the change. (I want all the games to have a bittersweet ending)
