# 🚀 About
Blaze Sudio is an open source graphical game creation software.

Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name! (Yes, it was originally a typo I decided to incorperate into the idea.)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

<!-- // TODO: A badge for when v3.0.0 is released and put it at the top -->

This is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! PRs are welcome!

This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) (I don't know whether I still need this or not...), [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). For pyLDtk, this is because I have edited it so much it barely resembles the original library (slight exaggeration, but still). And for the others, it was for similar reasons (and also installation problems and other things too)

# 📔 How to use
## 🛠️ Installation
Are you ready? This is the most complicated installation process of any python library that exists ever, even Tensorflow (yes, I know!) But, follow the instructions and you'll probably be ok. Remember to [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv) if you need any help.

1. Run `pip install Blaze-Sudio`
2. Rejoice in happiness as your library gets installed, pain-free

<small>Disclaimer: may not actually be pain-free.<br>Disclaimer of the disclaimer: I'll help you if you run into any issues via [github issues](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/issues/new/choose) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv), so it will be mostly pain-free (for you) as a satisfaction guarantee</small>
