(Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name! Yes, it was originally a typo I decided to incorperate into the idea.)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

# Things to note:
1. This is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! PRs are welcome!
2. This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) (Actually I think I removed that one... must check.), [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). This is for a couple of reasons:
    1. (The main one) I can modify it myself (they're very niche, unfinished things)
    2. It can't be installed with pip (last time I tried) (maybe it got taken down? I don't know, or maybe I'm just bad (says the person who made *this*))
    3. I don't have to wory about dependancy issues with those two packages (tho that's not that big of a deal)
    4. You guys don't have to install another package :)
    5. It won't ever change (unless I change it myself)
