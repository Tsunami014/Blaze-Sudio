# 🚀 About
[![Powered by Wild optimism](https://badgen.net/badge/Powered%20by/Wild%20optimism/yellow)]()

Blaze Sudio is an open source graphical game creation software.

Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name! (Yes, it was originally a typo I decided to incorporate into the idea.)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

This is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! PRs are welcome!

This project comes with 2 python libraries built into it;
 - [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) - I edited this library **SO MUCH** you wouldn't understand.
 - [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master) - I needed to integrate it with my existing Element class

The default theme is entirely taken from the `ThemeWood`, made by [Pixel-boy](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/) and [AAA](https://www.instagram.com/challenger.aaa/?hl=fr); and is freely avaliable [here](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack). Thanks heaps to them!!

# 📔 How to use
## 🛠️ Installation
[![Works on my machine](https://badgen.net/badge/Works%20on/my%20machine/green)]()

Are you ready? This is the most complicated installation process of any python library that exists ever. Remember to [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv) if you need any help.

1. Run `pip install Blaze-Sudio[all]`
2. Rejoice in happiness as your library gets installed, pain-free (hopefully).

### ⛏️ Installing from sauce 🍅
- Git clone and pip install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio.git
cd Blaze-Sudio
pip install .[all]
```
- OR just use the one line command:
```bash
pip install "Blaze-Sudio[all] @ git+https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio.git"
```
### 📜 Optional requirements
You don't need to install *everything*, so here is a list of all the optional requirements and what they do:
- `Blaze-Sudio[all]` - Installs all of the below.
- `Blaze-Sudio[game]` - Installs the required dependencies for the **game, graphics & collisions** module (everything you need to make a game with) including some extras for extra functionality (e.g. `utils`).
- `Blaze-Sudio[collisions]` - Installs the required dependencies for the **collisions** module.
- `Blaze-Sudio[image]` - Installs the required dependencies for the **element Gen** module.
- `Blaze-Sudio[graphics]` - Installs the required dependencies for the **graphics** module.
- `Blaze-Sudio` - Doesn't install anything, just the library. But nothing in it will work.

You can also install multiple of these at a time like so: `pip install Blaze-Sudio[graphics,collisions]`.

## 📚 Library usage & features
Demos are avaliable in `demos.py` for any main part of the library, which are all described in the subheadings below.

And if you want full, in-depth explanation of each thing Blaze Sudio has to offer and how to use it all, visit the docs: [Offine 🖥️](docs/game/README.md) / [Online 🌐](https://tsunami014.gitbook.io/blaze-sudios/main-functionality/game).

### 🧱 The collisions module `[collisions]` / `[game]`
`BlazeSudio.collisions` is something I have spent a very long time on. It contains many different classes and functions for all sorts of shapes; `Points`, `Lines`, `Circles`, `Rects`, `Polygons`, and more. with functions to check for collision, find where the shape is colliding, where the nearest point on that shape is to any other shape, find the tangent off of the shape at a certain point, **but** also there is a function to calculate what happens to the shape once it bounces off any other objects!! It's too exciting for me to be able to explain it here, so make sure you take a look at the `demos.py` and choose the `Collisions demo`.
### 💻️ The graphics module `[graphics]` / `[game]`
This is a module for having buttons, switches, colour pickers, scrollable screens, you name it - all in Pygame.
### 🎮️ The Game module `[game]`
A simple demo is kinda hard because you need an ldtk file to make the levels with, but if you want there are some demo games [here](https://github.com/Tsunami014/BlazeTests) for you to see how making games is structured.
It may be a little confusing, **BUT DON'T WORRY** as making a game is super easy with the help of the documentation, no matter how hard you think this may look. It is all explained there.
### 🖼️ The ldtk module `[game]` (`[collisions]` & `[graphics]`)
This module is built off of [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) but with many more features and much more polished. It is for loading `LDtk` files into a form easily able to be used in games and `pygame` applications and things.
### 🧪 The test module `[collisions]`
Some functions I made for testing that seemed useful. Also contains tests for different parts of the library (currently just the collisions tho).
### ➿ Element generation `[graphics]` & `[image]`
This module was designed to make making game elements easier (e.g. textures and stuff) and was inspired by other similar things (e.g. the one in Blender). It *kinda* works at the moment, but there are very little features (but making more is super easy) and not much functionality except for the editor, so if you wanted something fully complete then don't use this unless you'd like to help too..? PRs mostly\* welcome.

<small>*Unless it's about something like spelling or whitespace or other minor bits of the application I could fix very easily in one line; in that case just tell me and I'll fix it</small>

### 🧩 The utils module `[game]`
The utils module is full of random things that you may find useful, including:
 - `genCollisions`: Functions to generate collision Polygons from input pygame surfaces for finding collisions of tiles and things.
 - `wrap`: An entire module dedicated to the wrapping of images into circles. You **have** to see the demo, it's **AWESOME!**

## 💻️ The terminal script
If you have installed BlazeSudio into your global pip, you *should* be able to run the `BlazeSudio` command in your terminal. This is a script to really quickly make a new project or open the docs. you can run with `BlazeSudio --help` to see all the options.

# 🗨️ Contributing
If you would like to report a bug, security vulnerability, request a feature, etc. then [make a new issue about it](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/issues/new/choose). If you know how to code, you can fork this repo and make a PR!

Please join our Discord server here <small>(I need friends)</small>: [![Discord server link](https://badgen.net/discord/members/xr3phyEZtv?label=Discord&icon=discord)](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv) for any information, queries, bugs, conversations, etc. that you may have! Alternatively (as said before), you can post bug reports/ideas in the [Github issues](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/issues/new/choose).

Just modifying whitespace or anything else that doesn't actually do anything won't be accepted (but if it's a spelling miss-steak or a broken link or something then you can tell me about it on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xr3phyEZtv) and I can just fix it myself.)

And if you want more version compatability, please *ask on Discord* as that requires changing the 'auto' build script, and I don't want to do that unless I have to (I have to use 6 different computers every time I want to build the collisions module with github actions as it is), but even so due to the reasons stated I probably will not (unless it's upgrading the compatability)

And no, building it yourself and PR'ing that is not going to work. If I change the module it will be painful attempting to recompile the module into a version I don't have myself.

But if you're confused please ask on Discord, and thanks for any help making Blaze Sudios even better!!
