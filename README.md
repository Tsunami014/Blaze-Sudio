# üöÄ About
Blaze Sudio is an open source graphical game creation software.

Thanks to the one and only `@Imzafish` for the name! (Yes, it was originally a typo I decided to incorperate into the idea.)

Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)
 - One piece of code to rule them all!

<small>(But back then it was called AIHub, now that's a different thing; if you want to compare to something compare to when v3.0.0 was released)</small>

[![v3.0.0](https://badgen.net/badge/v3.0.0%20released:/Sept%2019,%202024?color=pink)](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

This is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! PRs are welcome!

This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) (I don't know whether I still need this or not...), [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). For pyLDtk, this is because I have edited it so much it barely resembles the original library (slight exaggeration, but still). And for the others, it was for similar reasons (and also installation problems and other things too)

# üìî How to use
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Are you ready? This is the most complicated installation process of any python library that exists ever, even Tensorflow (yes, I know!) But, follow the instructions and you'll probably be ok. Remember to [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv) if you need any help.

1. Run `pip install Blaze-Sudio`
2. Rejoice in happiness as your library gets installed, pain-free

<small>Disclaimer: may not actually be pain-free.<br>Disclaimer of the disclaimer: I'll help you if you run into any issues via [github issues](https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio/issues/new/choose) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv), so it will be mostly pain-free (for you) as a satisfaction guarantee</small>

### ‚õèÔ∏è Installing from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tsunami014/Blaze-Sudio.git
cd Blaze-Sudio
pip install .
```
## üìö Library usage
A simple demo is kinda hard because you need an ldtk file to make the levels with, but in this repo you can find some demo games, and //TODO: one day I'll make a repo with a whole bunch of JUST sample games and link it here.
But, the docs for making a game would be helpful, and are here: <!-- Pypi ignore -->[Offfine üñ•Ô∏è](docs/game/README.md) / <!-- End Pypi ignore -->[Online üåê](https://tsunami014.gitbook.io/blaze-sudios/main-functionality/game)

And if you want full, in-depth explanation of each thing Blaze Sudio has to offer and how to use it all, visit [the docs](https://tsunami014.gitbook.io/blaze-sudios/)!

## üíªÔ∏è The script
If you have installed BlazeSudio into your global pip, you *should* be able to run the `BlazeSudio` command in your terminal. This is a script to really quickly make a new project or open the docs.
