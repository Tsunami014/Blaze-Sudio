Also known as:
 - The putgamecreatorsoutofbusinessanator (Thanks to `@Faunder.real` for that one)

# Things to note
This is a very early version, and there are many things that are not yet implemented. Please be patient, and if you want to help, please do! PRs are welcome!

This project comes with 3 python libraries built into it; [pyguix](https://github.com/DarthData410/PyGames-pyguix) (I don't know whether I still need this or not...), [Pyldtk](https://github.com/LGgameLAB/pyLdtk) and [textboxify](https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify/tree/master). For pyLDtk, this is because I have edited it so much it barely resembles the original library (slight exaggeration, but still). And for the others, it was for similar reasons (and also installation problems and other things too)

Please join our Discord server here <small>(I need friends)</small>: [![Discord server link](https://badgen.net/discord/members/xr3phyEZtv?label=Discord&icon=discord)](https://discord.gg/xr3phyEZtv) for any information, queries, bugs, conversations, etc. that you may have!
